JavaScript: For the game logic, including upgrades, cost calculations, power-ups, and skill management.
DOM Manipulation: For dynamically creating and updating elements on the page.

How It Works:
Game Flow
Clicking: Players start by clicking on the cookie to earn gems. Each click increases the total number of gems.
Upgrades: Players can use their gems to purchase upgrades that enhance their clicking power or other gameplay elements. Each upgrade has a cost that increases over time.
Power-ups: Special boosts can be unlocked periodically to help players advance faster. These power-ups can double or triple their earnings for a set amount of time.

createUpgrades(): Dynamically creates the upgrade options and appends them to the page.
handleClick(): Handles the click event and updates the gems earned per click.
applyUpgrade(): Applies the effects of an upgrade when purchased.
